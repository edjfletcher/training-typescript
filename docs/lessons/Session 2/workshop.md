# Project

We will split into groups of about 3 people. Each group will aim to create a node service written in Typescript.

The service should be a book lookup.

In the [workshop directory](./workshop) you will find an openapi spec for the service expectation and a dataset.json with the book data that you can use.

The directory also has api tests on port 8080 to run to confirm you have created the correct output.

Your team has 30 minutes to create a working service which must have:
 - Map and/or set
 - structs 
 - In memory cache system

And for a bonus:
 - function interfaces

Once the 30 minutes have elapsed we will get together and each group will show off what they have created.
