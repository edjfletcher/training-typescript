# Training: Typescript (TS)
Welcome to a guide aimed at learning Typescript.

We assume some basic programming knowledge of at least one other language.

Javascript (JS) knowledge is helpful but not required as it will be covered in the prerequisites.

## What is Typescript
"TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale."
(https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

Typescript builds on ES6.

It can be compiled down to ES5 but knowing ES5 will improve both understanding and coding standards.

Typescript is designed to be built ontop of JS. It will never override or remove JS rules. It fits perfectly on top of JS development.

## Why use Typescript
Because Typescript is strictly typed it gives far clearer error messages and better information while coding which enables faster integrations

Through part 1 we will be showing you code in both JS and TS so that you can get a better picture of the benefit of using Typescript.

## Prerequisites
Knowing ES6 will help understand Typescript as it is built on top of JS.
